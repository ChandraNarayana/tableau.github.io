    <h1>Open Source Software from Tableau</h1>
    <p>Check out our open source projects on <a href="http://github.com/tableau">GitHub</a></p>
    <h2>Contributing Code to Tableau Projects</h2>
    <p class="lead">Many Tableau projects accept pull requests (check a given project's README) for bug fixes and for new features. The process for each varies slightly.</p>
    <h3>Bug Fix</h3>
    <p>Before a pull request (PR) will be accepted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There must be an open, approved issue for tracking the bug.</li>
        <li>The PR must contain a link to the bug's issue.</li>
        <li>You must have signed a Contributor License Agreement (discussed below).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>New Feature</h3>
    <p>Before you submit a new feature, make sure there's an open, approved issue for tracking the new feature.</p>
    <p>We will have an open discussion about the design. New features will be accepted based on alignment with the project direction, impact (positive and negative), and serviceability.</p>

    <h2>Contributor License Agreement (CLA)</h2>
    <p>Before we accept a PR, you must have signed a CLA. What is a CLA? It's a legal agreement that gives us permission to use the code you submit. You only need to sign the CLA one time.</p>
    <p>There are two flavors of CLA document: one <a href="./2016.01-TableauIndividualCLA.pdf">for individuals</a> and another <a href="./2016.01-TableauCorpCLA.pdf">for organizations.</a></p>
    <p>To sign the agreement electronically, please <a href="mailto:github@tableau.com?subject=Tableau%20CLA%20Request">email us</a> and we'll send it to you (this is our preferred method <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart"></span>).</p>
    <p>You may also send us a signed agreement via <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-send" title="email"></span>, <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope" title="snail mail"></span>, or <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-phone-alt" title="facsimile"></span>. See the agreement for more info.</p>
    <!--<p>You may also send us a signed agreement via email, snail mail, or facsimile. See the agreement for more info.</p>-->
