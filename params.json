{"name":"Tableau Open Source Projects","tagline":"","body":"## Contributing Code to Tableau Projects\r\nMany Tableau projects accept pull requests (check a given project's README) for bug fixes and for new features. The process for each varies slightly.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fix\r\nBefore a pull request (PR) will be accepted:\r\n* There must be an open, approved issue for tracking the bug.\r\n* The PR must contain a link to the bug's issue.\r\n* You must have signed a Contributor License Agreement (discussed below).\r\n\r\n### New Feature\r\nBefore you submit a new feature, make sure there's an open, approved issue for tracking the new feature.\r\nWe will have an open discussion about the design. New features will be accepted based on alignment with the project direction, impact (positive and negative), and serviceability.\r\n\r\n## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)\r\nBefore we accept a PR, you must have signed a CLA. What is a CLA? It's a legal agreement that gives us permission to use the code you submit. You only need to sign the CLA one time.\r\n\r\nThere are two flavors of CLA document: one [for individuals](./2016.01-TableauIndividualCLA.pdf) and another [for organizations](./2016.01-TableauCorpCLA.pdf)\r\n\r\nTo sign the agreement electronically, please [email us](mailto:github@tableau.com?subject=Tableau%20CLA%20Request&body=(please%20insert%20requested%20information%20below%20before%20sending)%0A%0AType%20of%20CLA:%09%09%09%09%3Cinsert%20Individual%20or%20Corporate%3E%0AFirst%20Name:%09%09%09%09%3Cinsert%20first%20name%3E%0ALast%20Name:%09%09%09%09%3Cinsert%20last%20name%3E%0AContact%20Email%20Address:%09%3Cinsert%20contact%20email%20address%3E) and we'll send it to you (this is our preferred method :heart:).\r\n\r\nYou may also send us a signed agreement via :email:, :mailbox:, or :fax:.
